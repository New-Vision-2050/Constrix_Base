  - Can be used on both frontend and backend.
  - Easy to integrate with React.
  - Well-maintained and active community.
- **Cons:**

# Why We Chose CASL

- The project is large and needs to scale in the future.
- We need fine-grained permissions (per page/tab/button).
- Ability to reuse permission logic in multiple places (Sidebar, Tabs, Table Actions, API).
- CASL provides a clean, customizable, and extensible API.
- Supports both RBAC and ABAC.

# Simple Documentation of Our Implementation

1. **Define Permissions:**
   - We created a `defineAbilityFor(role)` function in `lib/ability.ts` to define each role's permissions.
2. **Provide Permissions to the App:**
   - Used `AbilityProvider` (with React Context) to pass permissions to all components.
3. **Consume Permissions:**
   - Used the `useAbility()` hook to access permissions in any component.
   - Example: `ability.can('create', 'Article')`
4. **Protect the UI:**
   - Show/hide elements based on the user's permissions (e.g., show a button or tab only if the user has access).
5. **Easy to Extend:**
   - Add new permissions by simply editing the `defineAbilityFor` function.
